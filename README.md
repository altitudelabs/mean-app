# Lynk

## Developer Test
Lynk is a platform of experts where business clients (e.g. banks) can request phone consultations to get advice for their specific business needs (e.g. auditing). For each completed consultation, the expert will need to be paid.

1. In Terminal, run `npm install && bower install` to install packages and dependencies
2. Start MongoDB on your local computer
3. Import data/*.json into your MongoDB
4. Run `grunt serve` to run this on your localhost
5. Visit http://localhost:9000 in your browser (email: admin@admin.com / password: admin)
6. Get familiar with the application

## Your Task

Design file: straitsnetwork_invoicing_wireframe_v3.pdf

1. Take a look at page 1 of the design file
2. In the side bar navigation menu, add an entry called: "Invoicing", which should point to the route client/app/invoicing
3. Using UI-Grid (http://ui-grid.info/) show the list of consultations that are completed on the route client/app/invoicing, following the design file as much as you can

The end result should display all the completed consultations by their data.

Bonus: 

1. 'Chargeable Hours' and 'Notes' should be editable inline
2. Pressing enter will save the inputs back to the consultation
