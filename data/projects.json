    "description" : "Hi Jin,\n\nWe're restarting this effort for both cotton and leather so were hoping we could pick up where we left off and start scheduling calls for next week. I'm going to be running the cotton interviews and there will be another team member on our side (still TBD but will let you know as soon as it's finalized) that will run leather. In terms of what we're looking for, same as last time but would also like to see if we can find anyone with experience in mills on Mexico/Latin America (last time was almost all Asia if I remember correctly). Please let me know what other information I can provide you with to get things going.\n\nThanks,\n\nJake\n\n(specifically denim & twills)\n\n=======\nupdate: the topic is : \"experts on chemicals in the China or SE Asia region. Specifically, I am interested in learning more about the specialized chemicals used in the retanning, dyeing, fat liquoring, and finishing processes (e.g. syntans, oils, acrylics, etc.) - I would like to know information on usage, the specific chemicals that might be used (rather than just a generic category), and potentially industrial purchase price information\""

I therefore decided to make it a joint venture with a Danish partner where I have the full ownership of the company, my partner is assisting in strategy development and execution combined with international sales activity.\n\nIn august 2012 we received an unexpected honour when two of our spring 2012 Oolong teas won a triple gold medal in the prestigious British competition “The Great Taste Awards” – among industry experts called the British food and beverage Oscar®. It confirmed us about the work we do in the company.\n\nWe work hard to produce - and export - some of the world’s finest high quality superior Chinese tea products available with focus on no less than outstanding quality and customer service. For us an order from a customer is sign of trust and confidence in the work we do.

Sometime over the next week or so would be good\n\nMore for just a consultation but if good potentially future advisory or executive role even\n \nI would suggest doing a search first for someone in finance who might have worked at the companies below, after which a search for someone who might be working in the companies below with a finance background\n \nCompanies: Murphy, Newfield, Salamander, Coastal, Arrow Energy, Ophir, Kris Energy, Soco, Pearl, Hess, BG, Perenco, Premier Oil, Enquest, Petrofac, Oil Search\n\nNo just experience in international oil and gas, (not US or China or India) but preferably Asia (non China/India)",

    "description" : "Hi \n\nWe are working on a high priority client development opportunity in India (with a real estate developer). In this context, need your help in identifying an expert on design of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems for high-rise buildings. \n\nSuch experts could be working in firms such as Jacobs Engineering, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Exp, HDR Inc. Stantec Inc. etc. and should be either leading design functions or should be a senior designer. We are agnostic to the geography the expert has experience in (though would prefer an expert that can speak English well).\n\nCC: IN1310 (a client development effort). \n\nThis is a time critical request and would be great if you can revert with a few profiles before EOD.\n\nThanks a ton in advance!!\n\nRegards,\nAnish\n\n=========\n\n1) This is for a residential high-rise\n2) ED is Suveer Sinha and EM would be me\n3) This is a proposal for an engagement, hence even preliminary profiles should work for now  -\n\nFor this month, we plan to have 1-2 discussions to A) screen the expert, and B) start preliminary discussions on design optimization\nFrom July (when the engagement should kick-off), we would need to interact with experts over a 3 month period with a min. of 8-10 discussions\n\n4) Context of expert conversations: Would need expert inputs to review the designs (prepared by Indian firms) and come out with ideas for cost savings through design optimization of MEP systems\n\n=========\n\nThanks Jin. This is helpful but we are currently not very keen to onboard an Indian expert.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I have spoken to a few people who know the design space well, and they suggested that we try and identify MEP design experts from the following companies - WS Atkins, Arup, WSP Global, Ian Banham & Associates, Meinhardt, Cosentini Associates, and Buro Happold.\n\nThey also suggested that we look for subject specific experts, i.e., experts in HVAC / Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing / Fire fighting. This is because very few people have deep technical expertise across the board in this area. Therefore, could you please push our search to experts from these firms.\n\nRegards,\nAnish\n\nExperts from South East Asia and Middle East would be best suited (given that they are English speaking and in the same approx. time zone)."

    "description" : "Dear all,\n \nWe are looking to start a project with a pharmaceutical client in Vietnam.  As such, we are wondering if you could prepare a list of experts that could help to support this effort.  In particular, we are looking for\n \n1)    Medical professionals in hemophilia treatment or plasma treatment (head of practice in hospitals, representatives of medical boards)\n\n2)    Government policy makers in healthcare – those that decide on how funding is allocated to hospitals/ treatments\n\n3)    Current or ex-employees in pharma manufacturers in Vietnam (mix of MNC and local)\n\n4)    Current or ex-employees in pharma distribution companies in Vietnam\n\n\nIt would be great if we could get a preliminary list of profiles by this afternoon, 3pm\n \nI copy my colleague Duc, who will be assisting me on this\n \nThank you in advance,\nGerald"

    "description" : "Hi guys\n \nWe’re kicking off a new project (case code yet to be provided) in Australia and NZ. This is a bit different from the usual work that we do, because on this project we are looking at gyms and fitness providers instead of education. We need to speak to senior personnel who work in any of the big chain gyms in Australia NZ (fitness first, fernwood women’s gyms, curves, goodlife health, step into life, genesis fitness club, jetts fitness, plus fitness, anytime fitness, snap fitness are some names that come to mind, but feel free to do your own research and add big chains to this list. We are also interested in speaking to anyone at independent gyms which are of reasonable (~100 members) scale- perhaps a contact at the big chain gyms might know someone who is doing something like this)\n \nWe want to get an understanding of the following\n \n·         The market landscape for gyms/fitness centres in Australia/NZ- number of people participating, typical price points, major players, other ways of segmenting this market, typical buying unit (eg 1 month, 3 month memberships), frequency of payments, main methods of payment (direct debit vs cards)\n\n·         The type of IT systems used by gyms- who makes the buying decision, how long are contracts valid for, what software is used for functions like marketing, member sign up, payments processing, debt collection)\n\n·         Whether most of the aforementioned functions are usually done in-house or outsourced, if outsourced, to who? What are the key business drivers of such a decision?\n\n·         Mapping out the value chain of gyms\n\n \nwe are hoping to start interviews 2nd half of this week and do between 4-5 experts. End client is a potential investor in the Australia/NZ health and fitness space.\n\n================\n\nHi guys\n \nAs a second request, we need to speak to people at firms which design gym management software (this software typically deals with a range of functions such as new member sign ups, class management, payment processing, debt collection, CRM). Some shortlisted companies below, but others are also welcome if they’re in a similar line of business with an AUS/NZ focus.\n \n·         GymMaster (Treshna)\n\n·         Intellifitness (Intelligenz Solutions)\n\n·         Iconnect360\n\n·         Virtuagym\n\n \nWe want to find out more about the market dynamics of this industry- who are the key players, how saturated is the market, what are typical arrangements like between gyms and software providers (licensing, duration of contract, royalties), key decision criteria of buyers. Also relevant is to find out a bit more what the outlook for growth is.\n \nBecause of the type of questions we are asking, we suggest you try and speak with someone in sales.\n \nPlease do not approach anyone who works at the following firms/on the following products\n \n·         Clubware\n\n·         DebitSuccess\n\n·         Paysmart\n\n·         Harlands Group\n\n·         DFC\n\n·         Transaction services group\n\n \nEnd client is the same as previous request"

    "description" : "Hi \n\nWe are working on a high priority client development opportunity in India (with a real estate developer). In this context, need your help in identifying an expert on design of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems for high-rise buildings. \n\nSuch experts could be working in firms such as Jacobs Engineering, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Exp, HDR Inc. Stantec Inc. etc. and should be either leading design functions or should be a senior designer. We are agnostic to the geography the expert has experience in (though would prefer an expert that can speak English well).\n\nCC: IN1310 (a client development effort). \n\nThis is a time critical request and would be great if you can revert with a few profiles before EOD.\n\nThanks a ton in advance!!\n\nRegards,\nAnish\n\n=========\n\n1) This is for a residential high-rise\n2) ED is Suveer Sinha and EM would be me\n3) This is a proposal for an engagement, hence even preliminary profiles should work for now  -\n\nFor this month, we plan to have 1-2 discussions to A) screen the expert, and B) start preliminary discussions on design optimization\nFrom July (when the engagement should kick-off), we would need to interact with experts over a 3 month period with a min. of 8-10 discussions\n\n4) Context of expert conversations: Would need expert inputs to review the designs (prepared by Indian firms) and come out with ideas for cost savings through design optimization of MEP systems\n\n=========\n\nThanks Jin. This is helpful but we are currently not very keen to onboard an Indian expert.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I have spoken to a few people who know the design space well, and they suggested that we try and identify MEP design experts from the following companies - WS Atkins, Arup, WSP Global, Ian Banham & Associates, Meinhardt, Cosentini Associates, and Buro Happold.\n\nThey also suggested that we look for subject specific experts, i.e., experts in HVAC / Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing / Fire fighting. This is because very few people have deep technical expertise across the board in this area. Therefore, could you please push our search to experts from these firms.\n\nRegards,\nAnish\n\nExperts from South East Asia and Middle East would be best suited (given that they are English speaking and in the same approx. time zone)."

    "description" : "Hello Jennifer,\n \nOur Bain Private Equity team is kicking off a new project today that we could use your help on:\n \nContext: Our client is a financial investor thinking about purchasing Sperry Drilling, which is a Halliburton business being put up for sale in connection with their announced acquisition of Baker Hughes. Sperry Drilling’s primary operations are in directional drilling, measurement while drilling (MWD) / logging while drilling  (LWD) and drilling engineering solutions. We are primary interested in understanding:\n \n1)     How viable Sperry Drilling is as a standalone entity separate from Halliburton. To this end, we need to understand how drilling services are typically procured, how often drilling services are bought as part of a bundle of other services, how compelling the Sperry brand is, and how customers decide between Sperry and it’s 3-4 competitors.\n\n \n\n2)     How well-positioned Sperry Drilling is with regards to technology. To this end, we need to understand how technical innovation occurs in this market, how important technology is as a competitive differentiator, and how differentiated Sperry’s technology is relative to competitors.\n\n \n\nOur mandate is to investigate Sperry Drilling and the drilling market in APAC only.\n \nCustomers (n=10-20): We'd like to get good coverage of drilling customers, including international oil companies, national oil companies, and independent oil companies across APAC, with broad experience across offshore drilling, and conventional land drilling. Sperry’s customer base includes the following companies, which should be a good starting point:\n \n·         International Oil Companies (IOCs)\n\no    Shell\n\no    BP\n\no    Total\n\no    ConocoPhillips\n\no    Chevron\n\n·         National Oil Companies (NOCs)\n\no    PTT\n\no    Petronas\n\no    Pertamina\n\no     \n\n·         Independent Oil Companies\n\no    Anadarko\n\no    Apache\n\no    Chesapeake Energy\n\no    Devon Energy\n\n \nSome ideal job titles might be VP of drilling operations, VP of Procurement, etc.\n \nCompetitors (n=5-10): We’d also like to speak to current or former employees of some of Sperry’s competitors with a focus on APAC. These include:\n \n·         Weatherford International\n\n·         Schlumberger\n\n·         Baker Hughes\n\n \nExperts (n=5-10): It would also be valuable to speak to any industry experts or consultants in the drilling industry with a particular focus in APAC.\n \nTimeline: Phase 1 of this project will run from today until 7/1. As such, time is of the essence; we’d like to schedule 1-2 calls for tomorrow and ~30 calls altogether. The 1-2 calls for tomorrow would ideally include an industry expert since we’re still getting up to speed on the drilling world.\n \nScreening questions:\n \n·         Customers\n\no    Have you made purchasing decisions regarding drilling services in the past 12 months?\no    How familiar are you with Sperry Drilling in APAC?\no    Can you speak to the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors within the drilling market, especially with regards to technology?\no    Can you speak to how drilling contracts are typically structured (esp. in APAC)?\n \n·         Competitors\n\no    Can you speak to the major purchasing criteria involved in selecting a drilling provider?\no    Can you speak to how drilling contracts are typically structured (esp. in APAC)?\no    Can you speak to the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors within the drilling market, especially with regards to technology?\n \n·         Experts\n\no    Can you speak to the major purchasing criteria involved in selecting a drilling provider?\no    How familiar are you with Sperry Drilling?\no    Can you speak to the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors within the drilling market, especially with regards to technology?\no    How is the market of direction drilling evolving in APAC?\n \nCase code: Not yet created, but I will get back to you with this later in the day\n \nThanks for your help!\n \nBen\n \nBenjamin Soccal\n\nI have any update on this request:\n1.       First priority: Could you get back to me with another filtering. We are now looking after more technical profile in the drilling industry in APAC i.e. people who have had the chance to work with Sperry, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes as a customer. You can test their knowledge in the topic with the following questions:\n\na.       Do you understand the technical specificities required from drilling service providers for the different types of fields (e.g. onshore vs. deepwater)?\n\nb.      Do you understand the technical differences in products and services delivered between the 3 players and how they are positioned to deliver on the different types of fields?\n\nc.       Do you understand the trend of bundling/ unbundling services in the contract between drilling service providers and customers (IOCs, NOCs and independents)?\n\n2.       Second priority: Could you get back to me with 1-2 industry experts on the similar topic as my previous email with a focus on Russia instead of APAC? Please be very selective as we are planning to have 1-2 interviews max.\n\n \nPlease get back to me ASAP on the first priority (i.e. before 1pm)\n \nBen\n\n1.

Please test them on the topic.",

    "description" : "Hi Jennifer,\n \n \nMy name is Qin Zhu, and I’m a consultant with Bain Singapore.  I’m currently working on a project to sketch out the pro forma P&L (cost and revenue drivers) of developing a data analytics unit for a retail client, so I’m looking to speak with experts who’ve had experience rolling out big data teams/developing data analytic capabilities for a retail chain (preferably a supermarket). \n \nThe specific questions that we would like to answer are listed below: \nWhat are some typical benchmarks to determine the appropriate size/spend on a data analytics team, given a firm’s revenue?\no    How should we think about this e.g. ratio of DA cost to firm’s revenue?\n\no    Does this differ for inhouse/captive vs pure play DA companies? (companies that specialize in DA)\n\no    What percentage of that spend is towards employee pay vs software infrastructure vs overhead and etc.?\n\n-      What are types of upside and benchmarks for the upside/value creation from data analytics investments, especially in a retail/supermarket context. For example\n\no    Revenue from selling of data e.g. analytics report to a supermarket’s suppliers – what is typical pricing, upside from this\n\no    Performance improvement upside (from better inventory/stocking, cross-selling, etc.) – what are benchmarks for these?\n\no    Revenue from selling consulting services\n\n-      What is the typical revenue model for an internal DA shared service center/COE that offers services to other Bus within the firm e.g.\n\no    At cost, cost plus, market rate, etc.\n\n \nExperts that we’d be most interested in speaking with are:  \n-      Ex data analytics or chief information officers.  Preferably someone who has retail (supermarket) experience, who’s been in charge or have helped build out data analytic units and understand both the infrastructure and personnel needs.   \n\n-      Suppliers from data/IT firms that have helped retailers to roll out data analytical units."

    "description" : "Can help check if you have an ex-kfc global (ie franchisor) experts who can help us understand franchise markets in asia. Specifically, we want to understand markets which have multiple franchisees operating in them.\n\n1. Are you looking for an expert who is knowledgeable about several markets in Asia, or would you be open to talk to experts who can only cover 1 country? [single country is fine]\n3. By \"markets with multiple franchisees operating in them\" - do you mean countries where KFC has given franchise rights to several operators (franchisees) vs. sole operator? [correct]\n3. Do you have brief topics (eg. how to structure franchisor/franchisee relationship between single vs multiple operators)?\n-am trying to better understand the motivation for having multiple franchisees other than natural geographic barriers eg peninsular and east msia; what are the areas for collaboration (eg economies of scale, national marketing, product development) and areas of competition (adjacent territories, mall relationships, new development areas etc)\n4. What's your timeline? [asap; end of week latest - let me know if this is an issue.so we can explore other channels]\n\nYou can mention that we are an investment fund based in sg.\n\nhttp://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/575015/yum-to-pluck-new-franchisee-for-kfc-outlet-expansion"

    "description" : "Hi Maria,\nDo you have expert in the above sector for Philippines?\n \nFor now, we want someone who can comment in detail on:\n-       Market outlook – size, growth, consumer attitude\n\n-       Competitive landscape – we understand specialty stores are relatively nascent, so leave you to be creative here on expert profile e.g. expert may potentially worked at a brand owner previously (perfume brand employee); knowledgeable due to prior study of the market for distributors/ detailers, etc\n\n-       Key trends and growth drivers\n\n=================================\n\nThanks, Maria.\nTrouble you to refine this further:\n\n-       Fragrance sub-segment remains priority.  Appears that the experts are still more beauty care products driven.  If you are facing constraints here, please let us know.  Also, appreciate your feedback on nuances (if any), e.g. Fragrance market is not large enough to justify a single business head, etc\n\n-       Experts with a view of the growth outside of Luzon.  Particularly, growth prospects in areas such as Visayas and Mindanao – be it by way of distribution via modern trade or general trade, or direct retailing\n\n\nHope this helps.  Please do not hesitate to call to discuss.  Best regards.\nYeow Hua\n\n========================\nwhen you screen KPs, ask them if they cover those areas, luzon, mindanao and visayas. and also, how distributors usually group those areas and from where they manage them. that might help our research (", 
    "specialNotes" : "Questions can send to kps before consultations:\n1. What is the market size of perfume products in Philippines? \n2. Is the industry growing or shrinking? What are the major growth drivers? \n3. What is the industry trends (such as shift from traditional retail channel to e-commerce)? \n4. What are the key success factors for perfume distribution in areas like Mindanao and Visayas?"

As such, I think it would be helpful to speak to current/former employees of companies such as those above (and any other relevant ones) for a mix of these roles:\n-      General management\n\n-      Strategy\n\n-      Sales/marketing\n\n-      Any other roles that will be able to address some of the points above\n\n \nAs I mentioned, can we get a first cut of profiles by 4:30pm this afternoon? We have an internal meeting at 5pm and I would like to go through the list and present my suggestions to the team.\n \nI can send you screening questions afterwards and we will look to start scheduling these calls from next Monday.\n \nAs a heads up, we will also want to understand customer preferences and behavior a bit better, so will follow up with another request this afternoon for the customer list.\n \nPlease keep my colleagues copied on all correspondence as I am out of the office tomorrow afternoon. Heath will probably take the lead on scheduling tomorrow afternoon once we have narrowed down our list.\n \nThank you!\nIvan\n \nPS: case code is AQYC",
